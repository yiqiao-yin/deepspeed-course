# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

A teaching course, not an application. Each top-level numbered directory (`01_basic_neuralnet` … `09_vss`) is a **self-contained, runnable DeepSpeed example** that escalates in difficulty: toy MLP → CNN → LSTM → Bayesian MCMC → HuggingFace/TRL fine-tuning → GRPO RL → LoRA SFT of 20B models → video-text (LLaVA/NLLB) → video-speech (LongCat-Flash-Omni 560B).

There is no package, no shared library, no test suite, and no root `.gitignore`. Directories deliberately duplicate code rather than import from each other — a reader should be able to open one folder and run it without touching the rest. **Do not refactor shared logic into a common module.**

## The per-example contract

Every example folder follows the same four-file shape. When adding or editing an example, keep it:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `train_*.py` | Training entry point; calls `deepspeed.initialize(...)` and reads the JSON config |
| `ds_config*.json` | DeepSpeed config — ZeRO stage, fp16/bf16, optimizer, batch sizes |
| `run_deepspeed.sh` (or `submit_job.sh`, `run_training.sh`, `run_2xB200.sh`) | SLURM batch script, or a bare launcher for single-pod platforms |
| `README.md` | Full standalone walkthrough: hardware, setup, run command, expected output |

Larger examples add `HARDWARE_REQUIREMENTS.md` / `HARDWARE_GUIDE.md` / `MODEL_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY.md`.

Batch size consistency is enforced by DeepSpeed at startup: `train_batch_size == train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu × gradient_accumulation_steps × num_gpus`. Changing `--num_gpus` in a launcher without updating the JSON is the most common breakage.

## Running examples

```bash
cd 01_basic_neuralnet
deepspeed --num_gpus=1 train_ds_enhanced.py          # direct, e.g. RunPod / single pod
sbatch run_deepspeed.sh                              # SLURM, e.g. CoreWeave
```

SLURM workflow: `sbatch <script>` → `squeue -u $USER` → `tail -f logs/<name>_<jobid>.out` → `scancel <jobid>`. Every batch script does `mkdir -p logs` and writes `logs/*_%j.{out,err}`.

Environments are created with `uv`, not pip/conda:

```bash
uv venv myenv && source myenv/bin/activate
uv pip install torch deepspeed wandb
```

## Two target platforms

The README's central distinction, which shapes every launcher script:

- **CoreWeave** — shared SLURM HPC cluster. You SSH to a login node and *submit*; you never run training interactively. Scripts carry `#SBATCH` headers (`--gres=gpu:N`, `--partition=h200-low`, `--time`, `--mem`).
- **RunPod** — single-user pod with direct GPU access. Run `deepspeed ...` straight in the shell; the `#SBATCH` lines are inert comments.

`09_vss/run_2xB200.sh` shows the non-SLURM style: preflight checks on GPU count, free disk, and RAM before launching.

## Conventions to preserve

- **Secrets are placeholders.** Scripts contain literal `export WANDB_API_KEY=<ENTER_KEY_HERE>` and `export HF_TOKEN=<ENTER_KEY_HERE>` — they are instructional. Leave them as placeholders; never substitute a real value.
- **W&B is optional and soft.** Training scripts wrap `import wandb` in `try/except ImportError` and only enable tracking when `WANDB_API_KEY` is set. Keep new scripts runnable with no W&B installed.
- **Heavy docstrings and comments.** Line-by-line explanatory comments (including on `#SBATCH` directives) are the pedagogical point, not clutter. Match the surrounding density.
- **Type hints** on function signatures throughout the Python scripts.
- Scripts print banner blocks (`"=" * 80`, emoji headers) around phases — expected output in the READMEs matches this, so changing print formatting invalidates docs.

## Documentation site

`docusaurus-docs/` is a Docusaurus 3 site mirroring the examples, deployed to GitHub Pages at `https://yiqiao-yin.github.io/deepspeed-course/` by `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` — it triggers **only** on pushes to `main` that touch `docusaurus-docs/**`.

```bash
cd docusaurus-docs
npm install
npm start          # local dev server with hot reload
npm run build      # must pass before pushing — CI runs this with NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
npm run serve      # preview the production build
```

The build is the only CI gate in the repo. Broken internal links and bad MDX fail it.

- Every doc page needs `---\nsidebar_position: N\n---` frontmatter **and** an entry in `sidebars.js` under `tutorialSidebar` — a page missing from `sidebars.js` is orphaned.
- KaTeX math (`remark-math` + `rehype-katex`) and Mermaid (`@docusaurus/theme-mermaid`) are enabled; tutorial pages use ```` ```mermaid ```` blocks liberally.
- When you change an example's code or hardware requirements, update both its folder `README.md` and the corresponding page under `docusaurus-docs/docs/tutorials/`.
